## Java Programming Basics - Oracle University



 I recently completed the Java Programming Basics course from Oracle University and earned the Explorer Badge! This course introduced me to essential Java concepts, including:

- Variables, Classes, and Objects
- Loops, Arrays, and Conditions
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Exception Handling
- Java on Oracle Cloud (OCI)

I also gained hands-on experience using the NetBeans IDE to develop and run Java applications. This course provided a solid foundation for anyone looking to start programming in Java.
